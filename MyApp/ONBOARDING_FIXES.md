# ChoiceScreen Onboarding - Fixed Issues

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Profile Icon Positioning ✅
**Problem**: Profile tooltip was not properly aligned with the top-right profile icon
**Solution**: 
- Adjusted profile tooltip position to `top: 140, right: 10`
- This aligns the tooltip properly below the profile icon which is at `top: 80, right: 28`

### 2. Market & Soil Button Positioning ✅  
**Problem**: Market prices and soil monitoring tooltips were showing in the same position
**Solution**:
- Market button tooltip: `bottom: 200, alignSelf: 'center'`
- Soil button tooltip: `bottom: 140, alignSelf: 'center'` 
- Now they have different vertical positions to avoid overlap

### 3. Help Button Positioning ✅
**Problem**: Help tooltip needed better alignment with the bottom-right help button
**Solution**:
- Adjusted help tooltip position to `bottom: 160, right: 10`
- Better aligned with help button which is at `bottom: -40, right: 10`

### 4. Auto-Start Onboarding ✅
**Problem**: User wanted onboarding to show by default for first-time users
**Solution**:
- Confirmed auto-start logic is working correctly
- Added better debugging with console logs
- Increased delay to 1500ms to ensure UI is ready
- Added error handling to show onboarding even if AsyncStorage fails

### 5. Debug Features ✅
**Added**:
- `resetOnboarding()` function to clear AsyncStorage for testing
- Two debug buttons for returning users:
  - **Tour**: Restart the onboarding tour
  - **Reset**: Clear completion status (requires app restart to see onboarding again)

## How It Works Now:

### First-Time Users:
1. App loads ChoiceScreen
2. `checkOnboardingStatus()` runs and finds no completion flag
3. After 1.5 seconds, onboarding automatically starts
4. User goes through 7 steps of guided tour
5. Completion is saved to AsyncStorage

### Returning Users:
1. App loads ChoiceScreen  
2. `checkOnboardingStatus()` finds completion flag
3. No automatic onboarding
4. Two debug buttons appear:
   - **Tour**: Immediately restart the guided tour
   - **Reset**: Clear completion status for testing

### Onboarding Flow:
1. **Welcome** (center screen) - No arrow
2. **Voice Mode** (above voice button) - Up arrow  
3. **Manual Mode** (above manual button) - Up arrow
4. **Profile** (below profile icon) - Down arrow
5. **Market Prices** (above market button) - Down arrow
6. **Soil Monitoring** (above soil button) - Down arrow  
7. **Help** (above help button) - Down arrow

## Testing:
- Use the **Reset** button to test first-time user experience
- Use the **Tour** button to quickly test the onboarding flow
- Check console logs for debugging information
- Each tooltip should now appear in the correct position relative to its target element

## Key Improvements:
- ✅ Proper alignment with UI elements
- ✅ No overlapping tooltips
- ✅ Automatic start for new users
- ✅ Debug tools for testing
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging
