## üîß Technical Architecture

```
Audio File ‚Üí Speech-to-Text ‚Üí RAG Processing ‚Üí Structured Response
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì               ‚Üì
  sample.wav ‚Üí "Find my notes" ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí {action: "chat", summary: "..."}
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test with different audio files** containing various farming queries
2. **Try different languages** (Hindi, Marathi) for voice commands
3. **Test error scenarios** (non-audio files, corrupted files)
4. **Monitor response times** for optimization opportunities
5. **Add authentication** if required for production

## üéâ Conclusion

Your Voice Command API is **fully functional** and provides excellent intelligent responses with proper action classification. The system successfully:

- ‚úÖ Processes audio files
